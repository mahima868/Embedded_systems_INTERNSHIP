# SSIT_INTERNSHIP
Designed a cloud-connected embedded system using LPC1768 and ESP01 to control devices via ThingSpeak. Implemented UART communication and HTTP parsing to toggle an LED based on real-time cloud commands.
# Embedded ARM Cloud Communication and Control

This project was developed as part of an Embedded Systems internship at SSIT. It showcases a cloud-connected embedded system built using the LPC1768 ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller and the ESP01 Wi-Fi module. The system allows real-time device control using cloud commands retrieved from the ThingSpeak platform.

##  Project Overview

- The ESP01 connects to a Wi-Fi network and sends HTTP GET requests to a ThingSpeak channel.
- The LPC1768 microcontroller receives the response via UART and parses the JSON data.
- Based on the value of `field1` ("1" or "0"), the LPC1768 toggles an LED ON or OFF.
- The system runs entirely without an RTOS, making it lightweight and suitable for low-power embedded applications.
